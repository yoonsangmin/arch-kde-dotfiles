The core idea of the implementation is due to [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/ri4zko/comment/howapa9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3]@RealezzZ[/url] and the files are based on [url=https://store.kde.org/p/1461072/]Breeze Aurorae[/url]. The adaption for different styles and packaging is my work.
